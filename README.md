Well, when it comes to jokes everybody has an ever-ending smile on their faces, this is an extension that I have created that generates random jokes

#### Working:
So, This is my Cs50 project which I have created a Chrome extension using JavaScript, where this extension gives random jokes at a time...kinda a fun right? By the use of API, this extension generates jokes. 

Here the extension consists of five files 
* manifest.json
* background.js
* popup.js
* popup.html
* style.css

The manifest JSON file provides metadata about the extension such as the name, version and also specifies aspects of the extension's functionality

The background js file provides the logic for the extension to work accordingly, by the use of API it fetches the data ante provided to the extension 

The popup js files provide the data when it pops up while clicking what its function has to do during this.

The popup HTML file provides the layout of the extension a simple UI design 

The styles CSS file provides the style for the extension 

thus overall it functions as a joke generator that generates jokes whenever the user wants to.
